Currently an R-Shiny consultant. Previously worked as a software engineer (Google, IBM, Tagged.com) and web developer in tiny startups (Wish.com, MakeupBee.com, glittr.com, jauntr.com).

Obtained my MSc in Bioinformatics from the University of British Columbia (supervised by the amazing Jenny Bryan) and my Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, Canada. My masters thesis project involved developing computational methods to automatically analyze droplet digital PCR data.

I enjoy writing useful & reusable software tools to help others â€” check out my projects. In the past several years I've become an experienced R useR and an expert in R-Shiny.

I'm addicted to soccer, travelling at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates, and meeting new people :)

The projects page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) resume.

Grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel; moved to Toronto, Canada during my teens; worked in San Francisco after undergrad; crossed the border again to Vancouver, Canada for grad school; spent many months in other countries backpacking; returned to Toronto in 2017.

I also have an old blog, mostly from high school and some old travelling trips, that I'll leave here just because I want to have a reference to it somewhere.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
